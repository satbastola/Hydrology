    "Rainfall frequency analysis helps engineers and planners estimate how often specific rainfall events are likely to occur, such as a ‚Äú10-year storm.‚Äù These statistics are essential for designing drainage infrastructure, managing flood risks, and sizing stormwater systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SCS Curve Number (CN) method is a widely used empirical approach that estimates surface runoff from rainfall based on land use, soil type, and hydrologic conditions. When paired with frequency-based rainfall inputs from NOAA Atlas 14, it enables realistic modeling of watershed response across various return periods and storm durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This learning module is designed to reinforce your understanding of:\n",
    "- How rainfall depth varies with return period across different durations\n",

    "- The interplay between frequency-based rainfall and runoff generation\n",
